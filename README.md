We will take look particularly at VS Code and how the

Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms.

Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.
